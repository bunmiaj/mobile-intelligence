# mobile-intelligence
This repository hosts the R tutorial materials for the [Mobile Intelligence and Business](http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/academic-resources/course-results/course-details/index.aspx?cid=582) (MIB) course for the Spring semester, 2015. The files in here are organized into subdirectories as follows:
- **code** -- contains the **R scripts** of all the tutorials, which are in turn organized by topics
- **data** -- contains the sample **input datasets** used by the R scripts, also organized by topics
- **figures** -- contains the **output figures** of the R scripts, also organized by topics.

The topics covered in the tutorials (and according to which the subdirectories are organized) are as follows:
- **sna** -- social network analysis
- **spatial** -- geospatial analysis and visualization
- **clustering** -- spatiotemporal cluster analysis
- **mongo** -- accessing and querying data in MongoDB using the `rmongodb` package.

Some subdirectories in `code` contain helper functions, which may come in handy at times.
- **util** -- utility functions for miscellaneous uses.
